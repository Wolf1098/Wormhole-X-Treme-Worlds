v0.1.1 -

- We now store the world seed in our world config files. The seed value is based on what the world actually uses.
  This allows users to add worlds and have a valid seed stored in their config for later use. When the seed is a
  valid seed number (non 0) we call the world load with the specific seed. This way if someone wants to reset a
  world, all they have to do is delete the world folder on disk before starting the server.
  
- We now pay attention to external spawn change events and update our internal spawn location references as 
  appropriate.
  
- We now properly honor the creature spawn restriction options. We clear banned types of creatures at world load
  as well as any time a world is connected. We also cancel creature spawn events as needed.
  
- Minor performance change to our internal prettyLog method. Check to make sure system log even is appropriate
  for the log type we are generating.
