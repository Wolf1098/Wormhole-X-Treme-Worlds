v0.4 2011.04.24 09:20 PST:

- Initial sticky chunk support. We allow plugins to register chunks that do not unload. When the chunk is no longer
  sticky, we schedule it for unloading. We properly catch and cancel the required chunk unload events.

- Added support for player protections on a world by world basis. Drowning, burning, lava swiming, lightning strikes,
  falling damage, and all player damage. Controlled via the wxw modify and wxw create commands.

- Added support for world protections on a world by world basis. Fire spread, lava spread, water spread, lightning fire, 
  and lava fire. Controlled via the wxw modify and wxw create commands.
  
- Updated wxw info ... to be more useful. Colorized it.

- Updated help output for wxw modify and wxw create to be slightly more useful.

- Fixed typo in config loader for Neutral monster disable. 

v0.3 2011.04.21 02:17 PST:

- Added scheduler capabilities.

- Enabled after enable world entity removal via scheduler.

- Added timelock. Uses scheduler. Now users can lock their worlds to day or night. Defaults to no timelock enabled. 

- Added config.xml option to disable timelock and its scheduler. Defaults to scheduler enabled.

v0.2.1 2011.04.20 04:38 PST:

- World specific PvP controls. True or false. 

- Updated safe spawn code for normal worlds to only use highest y if spawn is covered. This allows indoor spawn locations. 
  Also now retain player pitch and yaw on spawn or go.
  
- Updated the find safe spawn location code to be modular. Can be used for more than just finding initial spawn locations now, with small enough xyz numbers ;)

- Used new modular safespawn in a 3^3*9 setup for finding a safe location to drop player if nether spawn location is built over. Overkill, but ... 

v0.2 - 2011.04.19 01:39 PST :

- Nether safe spawn generation has been completed. We scan up to (13^3)9 blocks for a safe place.

- Added '/spawn' command with default hard disable via config file. 

- Normal world safe spawn teleport. We'll drop the player on top of the highest block at the spawn location. 
  If users build to the skybox at spawn, it is not our problem. Nether still has no such thing. If a player builds
  over where spawn is on nether worlds, players will /spawn themselves into solid rock.

- Text seeds, you can use them. Not sure if they work the same as with vanilla... but. :)

- Ghasts are now considered to be hostile mobs, and dealt with as they should be.

- Squids are now considered to be neutral mobs, and dealt with as they should be.

v0.1.2 - 2011.04.17 08:41 PST :

- Reverted optimization in prettyLog. Apparently causes problems on some setups.

v0.1.1 - 2011.04.17 07:15 PST :

- We now store the world seed in our world config files. The seed value is based on what the world actually uses.
  This allows users to add worlds and have a valid seed stored in their config for later use. When the seed is a
  valid seed number (non 0) we call the world load with the specific seed. This way if someone wants to reset a
  world, all they have to do is delete the world folder on disk before starting the server.
  
- We now pay attention to external spawn change events and update our internal spawn location references as 
  appropriate.
  
- We now properly honor the creature spawn restriction options. We clear banned types of creatures at world load
  as well as any time a world is connected. We also cancel creature spawn events as needed.
  
- Minor performance change to our internal prettyLog method. Check to make sure system log even is appropriate
  for the log type we are generating.

- Changed connect command to load. Kept connect as alias for compatibility.

- Fixed a few NPE when trying to teleport to a world that is not loaded.

- Info command now shows world seed.

v0.1 - 2011.04.16 06:48 PST :

- Initial plugin release.
